    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data is <span style=\"color:red\">raw facts and figures</span> that can be processed to produce <span style=\"color:blue\">meaningful information</span>. Things are not data, but information about them is data.** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Things are not data:\n",
    "    * Objects, events, or phenomena in the real world exist independently of how we observe or measure them. For example, a tree is a physical entity, not data.\n",
    "* Information about them is data: Data is the recorded representation of some characteristics or properties of those things.  When we collect information about these real-world things, we create data. For instance:\n",
    "    * The height of a tree: 25 meters.\n",
    "    * The type of tree: Oak.\n",
    "    * The location: Latitude and longitude coordinates.\n",
    "    * This information is structured or recorded in a way that can be analyzed, shared, or used, which is what we call data.\n",
    "    * A car is not data, but its make, model, mileage, and price are data points we collect about it.\n",
    "    * A person's birthday is not data, but recording the date and associating it with their name creates data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is an abstraction that simplifies and organizes information about real-world entities, making it manageable for analysis, interpretation, and decision-making. Itâ€™s not the entity itself but a snapshot or a symbolic representation of some aspects of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "* Numbers: 42, 3.14\n",
    "* Text: \"Hello\", \"Data Structures\"\n",
    "* Images: A photo of a dog\n",
    "* Videos: A tutorial on Python programming\n",
    "* Age of people, price of laptop, number of likes for an instagram story\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Data Important?\n",
    "* Forms the foundation of all digital systems.\n",
    "* Drives decision-making in organizations.\n",
    "* Powers technologies like AI, ML, and Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current era, data is big. We live in the world of bigdata.\n",

    "## Data Structure\n",
    "**A data structure is a <span style=\"color:red\">way of organizing and storing data</span> so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A data structure is a way to store <span style=\"color:red\">non-constant data, that supports a set of operations</span>**\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of operations is called an **interface**\n",
    "* **Sequence**: Extrinsic order to items (first, last, nth)\n",
    "* **Set**: Intrinsic order to items (queries based on item keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogy: Like organizing books in a library to make finding a book easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=images/dat-structure.jpg width=\"400\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "<a href=\"https://medium.com/basecs/taking-hash-tables-off-the-shelf-139cbf4752f0\">Image source</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example, imagine you have a list of 100 numbers and you need to find the maximum value in that list. Without a data structure, you'd have to search through each number one by one until you found the maximum. But with a data structure such as an array or a tree, you can quickly access and manipulate the data to find the maximum value much more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are important for a variety of reasons. Firstly, they allow for efficient processing and manipulation of large amounts of data. As computers continue to become more powerful, the amount of data that we need to process and store also increases. Data structures help us manage and process this data in an efficient and effective manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, data structures are essential for algorithm design and analysis. Many algorithms rely on specific data structures to perform their tasks efficiently. By understanding how data structures work, you can design and analyze algorithms that are both efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, data structures are used in a wide range of applications across many different domains. From computer science and engineering to data analysis and finance, data structures are an essential tool for anyone who needs to work with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic and advanced data structures\n",
    "Basic data structures are the most common and straightforward structures, such as arrays, linked lists, and stacks. They are simple to implement and understand, but may not be as efficient as more advanced data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced data structures, on the other hand, are more complex and specialized, designed to solve specific problems and optimize\n",
    "performance. Examples of advanced data structures include trees, heaps, and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic data structures are useful for simple tasks, such as storing and accessing data in a linear fashion. They are easy to implement and use, making them a good starting point for beginners. However, they have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability, particularly when dealing with large data sets or complex data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced data structures, on the other hand, are designed to handle more complex tasks and offer better performance in specific scenarios. For example, trees are useful for hierarchical data structures, while graphs are ideal for representing complex relationships between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main strengths of advanced data structures is their ability to optimize performance. They are often designed to reduce the time complexity of specific operations, such as search or sorting, making them more efficient than basic data structures for those tasks. However, advanced data structures can also be more challenging to implement and understand, and may require more computational resources to work efficiently. They are also more specialized, which means that they may not be suitable for all applications.\n",

    "### Classification of Data Structures\n",
    "Two types: **Primitive Data Structures** and **Non-Primitive Data Structures**\n",

    "        - Fixed size, Fast access using index.\n",
    "    - **Stack**: A collection of elements following LIFO (Last In, First Out).\n",
    "    - **Queue**: A collection of elements following FIFO (First In, First Out)\n",
    "    - **Linked List**: A series of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.\\\n",

    "* Logical description of how data is organized and manipulated.\n",
