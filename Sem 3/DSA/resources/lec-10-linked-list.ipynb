    "## Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "* A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes.\n",
    "* A linked list is a data structure which allows to store data dynamically and manage data efficiently.\n",
    "* Each node contains:\n",
    "    * Data\n",
    "    * A reference (or pointer) to the next node\n",
    "* Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have a fixed size and allow dynamic memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=images/ll-1.png width=\"800\" height=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "* Few salient features\n",
    "    * There is a pointer (called header) points the first element (also called node) \n",
    "    * Successive nodes are connected by pointers.\n",
    "    * Last element points to NULL.\n",
    "        * A special value that indicates a pointer does not point to any valid memory location, essentially signifying that it is \"pointing to nothing\"\n",
    "        * Null pointer points to zero memory (in most architectures)\n",
    "        * Many CPU architectures treat address 0x0 as an invalid memory location, causing a segmentation fault if accessed, making it a safe way to indicate a null reference.\n",
    "            * x86 and x86-64 (Intel/AMD): Dereferencing a null pointer (0x0) triggers a segmentation fault.\n",
    "            * ARM (Used in mobile devices and embedded systems): Accessing memory at address 0x0 typically causes a hardware exception.\n",
    "            * PowerPC (Used in IBM systems): Uses 0x0 as the null pointer, causing an exception if accessed.\n",
    "            * MIPS (Used in routers and embedded systems): Similar to ARM, accessing 0x0 leads to a fault.\n",
    "            * RISC-V (Emerging open-source architecture): Follows the convention of 0x0 being an invalid memory address.\n",
    "    * It can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program.\n",
    "    * It can be made just as long as required.\n",
    "    * It does not waste memory space, consume exactly what it needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Array v/s Linked List\n",
    "<img src=images/ll-2.png width=\"800\" height=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In arrays\n",
    "* Elements are stored in a contagious memory locations\n",
    "* Arrays are static data structure unless we use dynamic memory allocation   \n",
    "* Arrays are suitable for\n",
    "    * Inserting/deleting an element at the end.\n",
    "    * Randomly accessing any element. \n",
    "    * Searching the list for a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Linked lists \n",
    "* Adjacency between any two elements are maintained by means of links or pointers\n",
    "* It is essentially a dynamic data structure\n",
    "* Linked lists are suitable for\n",
    "    * Inserting an element at any position.\n",
    "    * Deleting an element from any where.\n",
    "    * Applications where sequential access is required.\n",
    "    * In situations, where the number of elements cannot be predicted beforehand\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Linked Lists?\n",
    "* Dynamic memory allocation (no predefined size like arrays)\n",
    "* Efficient insertions and deletions (compared to arrays where shifting is required)\n",
    "* No memory wastage due to fixed-size allocation\n",
    "* Useful for implementing stacks, queues, and graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "* Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.\n",
    "* Doubly Linked List: Each node has two pointers (previous and next).\n",
    "* Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A node structure in C/C++/Python:\n",
    "**Node creation in C language** \n",
    "```c\n",
    "struct Node {\n",
    "   int data;\n",
    "   Node* next;\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Node creation in Python** \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Node:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, data):\n",
    "        self.data = data\n",
    "        self.next = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operations\n",
    "* Insertion\n",
    "    * At the beginning\n",
    "    * At the end\n",
    "    * At a specific position\n",
    "* Deletion\n",
    "    * From the beginning\n",
    "    * From the end\n",
    "    * From a specific position\n",
    "* Traversal\n",
    "    * Visiting each node sequentially\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Applications of Linked Lists\n",
    "* Implementing stacks and queues\n",
    "* Graph adjacency lists representation\n",
    "* Dynamic memory management\n",
    "* Undo/Redo functionality in applications\n",
    "* Navigation systems (e.g., browsersâ€™ forward & backward buttons)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "* Advantages:\n",
    "    * Dynamic size allocation\n",
    "    * Efficient insertions and deletions\n",
    "* Disadvantages:\n",
    "    * Extra memory for pointers\n",
    "    * Slower access (O(n) complexity for searching)"
