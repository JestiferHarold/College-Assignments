    "## What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "Classic “procedural” programming languages before C++ (such as C) often focused on the question “What should the program do next?” The way you structure a program in these languages is:\n",
    "1. Split it up into a set of tasks and subtasks\n",
    "2. Make functions for the tasks\n",
    "3. Instruct the computer to perform them in sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "With large amounts of data and/or large numbers of tasks, this makes for complex and unmaintainable programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the task of modeling the operation of a car. Such a program would have lots of separate variables storing information on various car parts, and there’d be no way to group together all the code that relates to, say, the wheels. It’s hard to keep all these variables and the connections between all the functions in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage this complexity, it’s nicer to package up self-sufficient, modular pieces of code. People think of the world in terms of interacting objects: we’d talk about interactions between the steering wheel, the pedals, the wheels, etc. OOP allows programmers to pack away details into neat, self-contained boxes (objects) so that they can think of the objects more abstractly\n",
    "and focus on the interactions between them. There are lots of definitions for OOP, but 3 primary features of it are:\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: grouping related data and functions together as objects and defining an interface to those objects\n",
    "* **Inheritance**: allowing code to be reused between related types\n",
    "* **Polymorphism**: allowing a value to be one of several types, and determining at runtime which functions to call on it based on its type\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is a paradigm that organizes data and behavior into \"objects,\" combining both state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
    "* Class: Blueprint for objects.\n",
    "* Object: Instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class defines a category, while an object is a specific instance of that class. Classes can be seen as templates for representing various concepts. \n",
    "\n",
    "An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified from a class of objects with common properties. An object has a unique state and behavior\n",
    "* the state of an object consists of a set of data fields (properties) with their current values\n",
    "* the behavior of an object is defined by a set of instance methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has\n",
    "    - a type\n",
    "    - an internal data representation \n",
    "    - a set of procedures for interaction with the object\n",
    "* an object is an instance of a type\n",
    "    - In python, 1234 is an instance of an int\n",
    "    - \"hello\" is an instance of a string\n",
    "    \n",
    "Objects are a data abstraction that captures\n",
    "* an internal representation through data attributes\n",
    "* an interface for interacting with object\n",
    "    - through methods (aka procedures/functions)\n",
    "    - defines behaviors but hides implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "A class provides a special type of methods called constructors which are invoked to construct objects from the class. Constructors are invoked when an object is created – they initialize objects to reference variables. A class may be declared without constructors: a no-arg default constructor with an empty body is implicitly declared in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of OOP\n",
    "* bundle data into packages together with procedures that work on them through well-defined interfaces\n",
    "* divide-and-conquer development\n",
    "    - implement and test behavior of each class separately\n",
    "    - increased modularity reduces complexity\n",
    "* classes make it easy to reuse code\n",
    "    - many Python modules define new classes\n",
    "    - each class has a separate environment (no collision on function names)\n",
    "    - inheritance allows subclasses to redefine or extend a selected subset of a superclass’ behavior\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### What are attributes?\n",
    "Data and procedures that “belong” to the class\n",
    "* **Data attributes**\n",
    "    - think of data as other objects that make up the class\n",
    "    - for example, a coordinate is made up of two numbers\n",
    "* Methods (procedural attributes)\n",
    "    - think of methods as functions that only work with this class\n",
    "    - how to interact with the object\n",
    "    - for example you can define a distance between two coordinate objects but there is no meaning to a distance between two list objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a method?\n",
    "* Procedural attribute, like a function that works only with this class\n",
    "* Python always passes the object as the first argument\n",
    "    - convention is to use self as the name of the first argument of all methods\n",
    "* the “.” operator is used to access any attribute\n",
    "    - a data attribute of an object\n",
    "    - a method of an object"
